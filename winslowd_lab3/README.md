Helpful Resources:
- https://static.lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch04.pdf

    Even outdated, the LDD is still an excellent text for understanding the logic of the linux kernel
- Examples `fourtune.c` and `fasync_example`

    Even with all the articles and documentation in the world, a good example makes the process of getting code up and running much simpler and faster.

- https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html

    This page helped me understand that `kill` doesn't only mean kill, and that there are many kinds of signals that can be sent in Linux.
